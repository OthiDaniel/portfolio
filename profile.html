    <p>Basketball has always been a thing for me since the year 2010. Carmelo Anthony has been my favorite player ever since, though he's beat now compared to other players drafted with him in 2003.</p>

    <p>I lost my father at a young age. Since then I have been responsible for myself and my mother who mwans the world to me. I'd give up all the oxygen I have for her.</p>

    <p>I have a 13 month old daughter, Syrai, whom I love so much.</p>

    <p>I am currently a student at Moringa School pusuing a certificate in computer   programming. Before Moringa I was a student at Kenyatta University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering.</p>

    <p>Below is a list of projects I have done in Moringa.</p>
